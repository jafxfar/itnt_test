The help of business angels in organizing all processes can be so significant that finances often go by the wayside. The angel round can also be called a kind of seed round. The main difficulty here is to understand in time that your startup needs not only money, but also organizational support. And, of course, it can be difficult to find an investor and a mentor in one person.",
